This course will cover basic concepts and design trade-offs related to
programming languages. The first half of the course focuses on functions,
types, scope, storage management, exceptions, and continuations. The second
half covers object-oriented features and concurrency. We will conclude with a
few special-topics in programming languages. The class also has a number of
small labs where students get to implement some of the language features
discussed in class.

#### Textbook

We will occasionally be following John Mitchell's <a
href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AUUgAwAAQBAJ">Concepts In Programming
Languages</a> textbook and assigning reading from this book and various other
online resources and papers. Some of the book chapters have been revised, we
will be handing out PDFs of these chapters. Cheaper renting options for the book
seem to be available online (e.g., on <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Programming-Languages-John-Mitchell-ebook/dp/B00AHTN2TA/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=">Amazon</a>).

If you are serious about programming languages Benjamin Pierce's <a
href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming
Languages</a> is a must.
