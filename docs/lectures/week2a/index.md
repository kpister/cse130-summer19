#### External sources

If you have not worked with Haskell before, take some time to familiarize
yourself with the basics of the language. The chapter above is a good start.
But there are many other sources to take advantage of, including:

- Brent Yorgey's [Haskell Basics](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/starting-with-haskell/introduction-to-haskell/1-haskell-basics) lectures.
- [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) is also a good book to read through.
- [A history of Haskell: Being lazy with class](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1238844.1238856) is a fantastic read, and there is a similarly engaging [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06x8Wf2r2Mc). 
- [A history of Haskell: Being lazy with class](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1238844.1238856) is a fantastic read. 
- [A Gentle Introduction to Haskell 98](https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/index.html) 
- [The Haskell 2010 Language](https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellpa1.html)

### Source code used in class

Below you'll find the source we used during lecture. You can run these with
GHCi (e.g., from [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)).
