### Virtual Machine

Installing and setting up Haskell can be difficult on non-Un\*x machines.
If you prefer to use a presetup VM, you can download one from the link below.
Notes: 

- This VM is built with VirtualBox, you will need to download their VM Manager to use it.
- This VM is 8gb. The download itself is 1.6gb.
- The VM comes with Node and Haskell, as well as the pa's already downloaded and setup.
- To SSH into the VM run `ssh -p 2222 student@127.0.0.1` while the VM is running
- There are two accounts: student (password: lambda) and root (password: plrocks)
- The PA 3 VM is identical to the original VM, but uses only GHCI instead of stack.

The new VM is identical to the other VM, but uses GHCI instead of stack.
`ghci Calculator.hs` to run etc.
